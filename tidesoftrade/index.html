        Inspired by The Pirate and Traders of the West Indies, a game published by William Spooner in 1847, Tides of Trade was created to be featured in the University of Miami Lowe Art Museum as part of its Antillean Visions exhibit. Tides of Trade  puts players in the shoes of a trader trying to make a living during the treacherous Golden Age of Piracy.  Players venture across the Caribbean, competing to obtain goods from the different islands while avoiding the threats that lurk at sea. The first player to make it back to his home port with two sets of four matching crops wins!
