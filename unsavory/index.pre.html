							<p>According to <a href="http://rocunited.org/roc-serving-while-sick/" target="_blank" class="footnote">multiple</a> <a href="http://www.iwpr.org/publications/pubs/44-million-u.s.-workers-lacked-paid-sick-days-in-2010-77-percent-of-food-service-workers-lacked-access" target="_blank" class="footnote">surveys</a> the majority of restaurant workers in the United States do not get paid sick days. Perhaps more troubling, many of these workers <a href="http://kitchenette.jezebel.com/your-waiters-are-violently-sick-while-serving-you-food-1609379121" class="footnote" target="_blank">feel forced</a> to <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/ehs/ehsnet/plain_language/Food-Workers-Working-When-Sick.htm" target="_blank" class="footnote">work while sick</a>. Some <a href="http://www.restaurant.org/Downloads/PDFs/advocacy/maps/map_paidleave.pdf" class="footnote" target="_blank">states and cities</a> have passed legislation to require employers to offer paid sick days, but there's an organization that doesn't want to see this happen: <a href="http://www.restaurant.org/News-Research/News/Cities-and-states-debate-paid-sick-leave" class="footnote" target="_blank">The National Restaurant Association</a>.</p>
							
							<p>The other NRA argues that mandating paid sick leave for employees would terrible for businesses. Even if that was true, <a href="http://www.cepr.net/documents/good-for-buisness-2014-02-21.pdf" target="_blank">which it is not</a>, do you want the people that are preparing your food to do so while sick?

						<div class="box">						
							<h1 class="heading">Get Involved</h1>
							<p>The best solution to this problem is national legislation. The <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1286" target="_blank">Healthy Families Act</a> would allow workers to earn up to a minimum of 7 paid sick days a year. You can show your support by <a href="https://secure2.convio.net/npwf/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=491" target="_blank">contacting Congress</a> and telling them what you think. You can also support <a href="http://www.paidsickdays.org/campaigns/" target="_blank">local campaigns</a>.</p>
			
							<p>You can also show your support for restaurants that offer their workers paid sick days. Restaurant Opportunities Centers United has a <a href="http://rocunited.org/dinersguide/" target="_blank">mobile app</a> that rates restaurants on their treatment of workers. The most profitable restaurants in the United States are listed in addition to ROC identified High Road restaurants that have made commitments to a better workplace environment. The list is not exhaustive, but it allows you to submit restaurants that aren't listed.</p>
